# phys_thesis
This directory contains the code pertaining to my thesis simulation of optical pumping. My thesis is attached for easy reference. I also attached the LaTeX and supporting files in case the template ever needs to be used. I plan on making an walkthrough of the simulation, how it works, and why its useful: for those without at physics or AMO background.
