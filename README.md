# phys_thesis
This directory contains the code pertaining to my thesis simulation of optical pumping. My thesis is attached for easy reference. I also attached the LaTeX and supporting files so that the template can easily be copied. I plan on making an walkthrough of the simulation, how it works, and why its useful: for those without at physics or AMO background. optical_pumping.py contains the source code for my computational simpulation. It can be run in any Python environment, some packages may need to be installed. The LaTeX files can be run, edited, and compiled on the free platform Overleaf or any LaTeX supporting text editor.
