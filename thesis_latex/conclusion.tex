\chapter*{Conclusion}
This thesis builds upon the work of other students and Nathan Lundblad. The thesis establishes a theory of quantum statistics of bosons and the formation of a state of matter known as Bose-Einstein Condensation. From there the typical steps followed for cooling atoms to temperatures of below $100nK$ are explained. These steps include forms of laser cooling, optical pumping and magnetic trapping, and finally evaporative cooling. This thesis then builds and describes a computational simulation of the optical pumping process. This program establishes a relationship between the desired proportion of trappable atoms and the number of photon scatters required per Rubidium atom. From there, \textbf{Equation 2.3} can be used to appropriately adjust the laser specifications. Lastly, the thesis describes the progress towards building an optical pumping set up for the NASABEC machine and outlines the next steps towards completing this process. 

Soon enough, with some dedicated students and hard work Bose-Einstein Condensation can be realized on the NASABEC machine. I'm \textit{pumped} to hear about it!
