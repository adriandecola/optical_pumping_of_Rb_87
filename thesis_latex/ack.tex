I would like to express my thanks to my mom for her support, love, and encouragement throughout my academic journey. Thank you for always being there for me. Her support, guidance, and encouragement have been invaluable to me. I am extremely grateful for her sacrifices to support me. 


I would also like to thank my advisor, Nathan Lundblad, for his guidance and instruction. His hours of teaching have been extremely valuable to my learning. Thanks to my teachers in the Physics, Computer Science, and Economics departments who have been influential to my learning. I would especially like to extend my gratitude to Hong Lin, who has been been extremely influential in forming my reasoning skills and fostering my interest in Physics. \cite{nlundblad} \cite{hlin}


In addition, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all the previous researchers whose work and theses gave me a foundation in this project and a learning reference. \cite{sshea}\cite{mcwik}\cite{dpaseltiner}


Finally, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of all the individuals who have supported my personal and academic growth along the way, including my fellow colleagues, friends, and mentors.
